  abstract = {AFF3CT is an open source toolbox dedicated to Forward Error Correction (FEC or channel coding). It supports a broad range of codes: from widespread turbo codes and Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes to more recent polar codes. The toolbox is written in C++ and can be used either as a simulator to quickly evaluate algorithms characteristics, or as a library in Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems or for other specific needs. Most of the decoding algorithm implementations aim at low latency and high throughput, targeting multiple Gb/s on modern CPUs. This is crucial in both simulation and SDR use cases: Monte Carlo simulations require high performance implementation as they commonly target the estimation of approximately 10^{12} bits. On the other hand, the implementations in real systems have to be very efficient to be competitive against dedicated hardware ones. Finally, AFF3CT emphasizes the reproducibility of state-of-the-art results by providing public references and open, modular source code.},
